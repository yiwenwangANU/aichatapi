    transcript:
      "- I just bought this train and it is currently barreling full-speed towards that giant pit over there. We're also crashing countless cars, blowing up thousands of\nsticks of real dynamite, and even putting 10 jet engines on a car. Just to show you the most\ninsane experiments of all time. Starting with filling a house\nwith over 100,000 fireworks. Please do not try this in your house. For this experiment, each of the boys will hide\na dummy in my new house to see if it's even possible to survive. - Water and fire don't mix, my mannequin is going to survive. - Mine's in the fridge. - Go in, come on. Let's blow this house up. Hey be careful. If you accidentally press\none, the house explodes. - Oh my goodness.\n- Please. Where's your mannequin? - Bathtub.\n- Fridge. - Under the washer. - Tareq?\n- Front porch. - Oh yeah, it's sitting right there. This is gonna be the coolest thing you have ever seen in your life! - Yes! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Fire in the hole! - Oh my God! - What happened to the house? I can't even see it anymore. - Oh my god! - I don't think our mannequins are gonna make it. - The house burned all night, until there was literally nothing left, including all the mannequins. Next experiment. We're about to play Tug-of-War between this real military tank and these two school buses. And the loser gets dragged into the pit. - There's no way the tank loses. - We're probably gonna lose. - No, we're not. - Now obviously, people\ncan't be in these vehicles, 'cause they'll die when\nthey fall in the pit. So this remote actually controls the tank. This feels illegal. 3, 2, 1. Go! - I'm full throttled right now. You're done for! Oh!\n- Oh, we're screwed. - The buses are done for. Oh my god. - Oh my god! - Oh my god! - Do you hear the buses beeping? Its horn's going off. - We're gonna go investigate\nthe bottom of the pit to see the buses. - Oh god.\n- Oh, no. I need to stop looking down this is... Stop moving!\n- I'm not moving! - We're in the pit. Oh my gosh. Bro, look at that. Why'd the bus think it\ncould beat the tank? - I don't think it did. - Later in this video, a train's gonna come off those tracks and land right about there. But before we do that, this is $50,000, and it is surrounded by\nthousands of pounds of TNT. And this is Will. - What's up guys? - See that crate in the field?\n- Yeah. Oh, man. - That is around 1% of the explosives surrounding this money. - Are we safe standing here? - Uh yeah, you'll be fine. Here's my credit card. Spend as much money as you\nwant to protect this 50 grand. I don't care if you use wood, bricks, or even steel to protect this money. Whatever's left of this 50 grand when that TNT blows up, you keep. Good luck building walls. - All right, let's make $50,000! - I don't think he stands a chance. The first thing Will did was buy 12 industrial water containers and filled them with\n20,000 pounds of water. - I'm really worried that Jimmy's TNT is gonna get through this. - And he should be, because this isn't even close\nto enough to stop the TNT. Meanwhile, we're gonna\ntest another experiment. In a previous video, we\nput a jet engine on a car and it jumped eight buses. So this time we put 10\njet engines on the car and we're to see if it\nflies 10 times further. When this car flies off this ramp, I think it's gonna go past\nall the buses into the trees. - I think it's gonna hit the first bus. - Our guesses couldn't be further apart. He's currently matrix-ed into the car, so he sees what the car sees. Chris!\n- Hey! - Oh, should we move? - Yeah, we're sending a rocket car. - Oh, okay. - 3, 2, 1. Send the jet car! The car's coming straight at us. - I lost signal. - Maybe we should jump? - Now I'm straightening it. - Oh, my god! Yeah!\n- What the heck? - Whoa! Wait, wait. We broke the ramp! - I think it was a success.\n- Yes. The jet car easily cleared all 12 buses and literally left a crater in the road. I love how this block of engine's just on the road. - Yeah, it's still smoking. Whoa! - Oh, it's leaking.\n- Oh, and it's smoking. - And now we're back at the giant pit. If you jump in this deep pit and land on a thousand bouncy balls, would you die? - I'd love to know. Nolan, catch! - Catch what? What are we doing? - Goodbye. Oh! Oh. - You completely missed! - Luckily we have more mannequins. Will it survive? Pay attention! - Oh. Oh! - Oh, buckets! - Hey Jimmy! What if we dropped the car in it? - I think you know what's about to happen. - Yo! - Clearly that mannequin didn't survive. Next bit. Meanwhile, Will was desperately trying to protect his $50,000. He's honestly taken\nthis way more seriously than I thought he would. - In the past four days,\nI've hired some professionals and we've already built\nthe cinder block wall, filled it with matches, and we're already on our\nsecond cinder block wall. This dynamite is not getting through. - You blew my expectations\noutta the water. How about this? If you let me double the\nTNT, I'll double the money. - So a hundred grand, double the TNT. - Yeah, but if it blows\nit up, you get nothing. - Take the deal! Take the deal! - Okay! Okay!\n- It's a deal baby! Deal baby! - And while he kept working,\nthe boys and I went bowling. And the bowling balls are these cars. - I'm ready to see some destruction. - Let's see if I get a strike. Hey, first bowl a strike. Oh, it's not going straight. - Oh, it's coming in our direction. We should move. We should move. We should move.\n- Nolan, watch out! - Oh, into the field. There it goes. Oh it's turning around. - Oh, it's coming back! - Oh God.\n- It's coming back. The car's got a mind of it's own! - It's coming back! - Take number two. Oh, that's a perfect strike. - Whoa! - Whoa!\n- Let's go! - I love cars hitting things! - And if you're wondering, the other car is still going in circles. During this bit, me and the boys have been wearing some brand new designs, which you can now buy on our new store, MrBeast.store. 3, 2, 1. We switched from ShopMrBeast.com,\nwhich was very long- - Move over! Move over! - to MrBeast.store. Oh, my gosh! - Ooh!\n- No way! - Whoa! - We just about died. - I'm gonna show you how to\njust hit a full strike easily. - Okay. - All right. Here comes a strike, baby. - A .store domain is the perfect choice for anyone looking to\nsell anything online. - That was the worst throw yet. - That was the best throw yet! - That was awesome! - If you're looking to set up a store, it should be at .store domain, so your customers clearly know\nthat your website is a store. - This is Carl's car. - Unlike .com, MrBeast.store\ntells the world that the website is my store. Oh. Don't forget to head to MrBeast.store and buy our brand new merch, right now. Since I doubled Will's money and TNT, he's completed a seven-layer fortress of 20,000 pounds of water, mattresses, a cinder block wall, four mattresses, a second cinder block wall, an additional 32,000 pounds of water, all packed in with a final wall of dirt. - But I actually have another layer that Jimmy knows nothing about. Jimmy will never see this one coming. - What? - Hey, Jimmy! - How am I supposed to blow up Feastables? - That's the point. - And with the TNT doubled, it's time to put Will's\nbunker to the test. I also brought number 40,\nfrom 1 throughout 100, back to help us blow up all this TNT. You're in charge of the button. Don't press anything yet. Oh god. Moment of truth. Whenever you're ready, press the one. I'm nervous. Whoa! - Oh my god! - Oh, that money's gone for sure. - Oh my god! - Bro, look at that smoke cloud! - I can't even see anything. Is it okay? - Wait, I think I see\nmoney falling from the sky. - No! Seven days of work just went up in flames. I don't know if I've got this. I gotta see if my money's okay! - Why are we running? - I'm running 'cause he's running. - Oh my goodness! Oh, there's so many stacks! - We counted out the money and over $95,000 survived the explosion. - I just won $95,000! - Congrats on the 95 grand. Let's go see what happens if\nyou drive a train into a pit! - Yeah!\n- Whoo! - And now's the moment\nyou've all been waiting for, a train is gonna go\nfull-speed down those tracks into this giant pit. If you were on this train,\nwhere would you sit? - I put my mannequin in the cabin. Statistically the safest\nplace to be on a train. - All right, you got this. - All right, we're gonna\nsit him right on the front. You're not going anywhere. - We're gonna give the\nFeastables bar a front row seat. Stop eating Hershey's. Eat Feastables. We have waited our entire\nlives for this moment. This is going to be epic. Nolan, send the train! - The train's coming! Let's do this! - Oh my god. Here it goes! - Oh my god, here it comes! - Oh, my god! - Whoa! Look at that! That might have been the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life. - Are you kidding me? - Yeah, my mannequin didn't survive. - Train versus pit, the pit won. I hope you enjoyed the video. Let's end it with an explosion. - Ooh! That is so hot! ♪ Mr. Beast ♪",

      "Intro - This is the biggest... hottest... and most explosive- - Oh my god. - Video on fireworks ever, covering everything from\nthe invention of gunpowder to how fire can burn underwater, how fireworks are made,\nthe colors, shapes, fuses. To how they're launched. We'll even see what it's like\nto fly through fireworks. (fireworks popping) Mr. Beast has got nothing on this. This video was sponsored by KiwiCo. More about them at the end of the show. (drone buzzing) - I cannot believe the precision with that huge camera on there. Gene is gonna try to fly the FPV drone actually like through the\nfireworks as they explode. You ready Gene? - I think So. - Gene makes the channel called Potato Jet and he does tech reviews, but also lots of very filmic stuff. - [Gene] Lot of- - Lot of drone work. - Lately a lot of drone stuff. - Okay. - A lot of fast drone stuff.\n- FPV drones. - Like this one.\n- this one. Are you willing to fly\nthis into a firework as it's exploding? - That's the goal. If I can catch it, that's the hope. But we set it up just for that.\nSo I think we could get it. (drone buzzing) - The first recorded instance\nof something like a firework occurred in China over 2000 years ago where people would get a piece of bamboo with the ends closed and they\nwould throw it in a fire. So as it heated up, everything inside would get hot and expand and eventually burst, creating this bang, which they thought\nscared off evil spirits. Then they developed black powder and they put black\npowder inside the bamboo to make an even bigger bang. That was much more impressive. I wanna test out the earliest\nknown recipe for gunpowder. Making gunpowder It involves three ingredients that you can find out in nature. The first is potassium nitrate, which actually comes\nfrom bat and bird guano. Once they poop in the cave\nand it dissolves in water, you get these white crystals coming out. The second ingredient is sulfur. These yellow crystals you can\njust find on the side of hills or around thermal vents. And the third ingredient is honey. That is the major fuel for the gunpowder. Now I'm gonna mix this all up. Looks like it could be frosting. So yummy. Earliest known recipe for gunpowder. What people observed was when\nthey heated up this mixture, it would spontaneously catch fire. I have no idea how big of\na thing this is gonna be. This is only about a gram of it, so I don't think it's gonna be huge. As we heat up that very\nprimitive gunpowder, we should see it burst into flames. It's gotta be close. Here we go. Here we go. Yes, we have made gunpowder. Now that took a long time\nbefore we saw the fire. So why is that? Well, honey contains a lot of water and that's gonna slow down the rate at which this is gonna start to combust. People figured out that a\nbetter fuel was charcoal. Charcoal There are three things\nyou need to make fire, fuel, oxygen and heat. In most fires, the oxygen\ncomes from the air, but in gunpowder, the oxygen is supplied by\none of the solid ingredients. The potassium nitrate\ngives you the oxygen. It's KNO3, so there's a\nlot of oxygen in here. And then the charcoal provides\nthe fuel, that carbon. Charcoal is basically just carbon, but it works better than other\nforms of carbon like graphite because it contains\nthese microscopic pores and that enables the\nreactants to mix much better. They can actually get inside those pores. So if you mix potassium\nnitrate with the fuel, charcoal and add heat from a lighter, you should have all the\ningredients you need to make fire. So the question is, will this burn? It seems like little bits\nof it are catching on fire and just like sparking up from there. But the trouble with this reaction is that it has a high activation energy. So it needs a lot of heat to get going. Whoa. There it goes. That is cool. (cheerful music) I can see little balls of molten stuff in the crucible there. That is awesome. So we do have oxygen and fuel\nand we can get that reaction, but it's just not a\nvery explosive reaction. This is where the sulfur comes in. Sulfur starts reacting\nwith the other ingredients at lower temperatures, and\nthose reactions give off heat. The sulfur is gonna act like kindling. It's gonna create that initial bit of heat that the potassium nitrate\nneeds to really break it open and then, you know, everything can react. So that's what I wanna do,\nI wanna try to mix sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal, which is like your quintessential\nrecipe for gunpowder. And the amounts that you need of this have been pretty stable\nfor like 800 years, which is about 75% potassium\nnitrate, 10% sulfur, and 15% charcoal. Those are the right mixtures so that you have just the right\nnumber of each type of atom to fully react and release\nthe most energy possible. So I wanna test how long it\ntakes for fire to burn down about a meter of this homemade gunpowder. Let's let her rip. There it goes. Hey, it's going so slow. (suspenseful music) Come on, you can do it. Go, go, go, go, go. Wow, it made it to the end. You know what I think the problem is the granules of charcoal that I've got and these grains of potassium\nnitrate, even the sulfur, they're all a bit big. So to actually get that\nreaction to happen fast, it's not really working. So what I wanna do is compare that to store bought gun powder from, you know, a factory that's actually\nground up all those particles to be really tiny. So all the reagents are\nreally close together. Oh my... - Whoo! - That is impressive. (suspenseful music) (laughs) Yes. That is gunpowder. That makes mine look so amateur. The chemical reaction that occurs in the combustion of\ngunpowder is complicated, to say the least. But a number of the\nproducts formed are solids, and that's why burning gunpowder\ncreates a lot of smoke. The neighbors have gotta be\nlooking at this and being like- - That is so...\n- What the... The thing about gun\npowder is if you burn it Burning gunpowder when it's just exposed to the air, it doesn't really explode. And I think of gunpowder as explosive. But in order to see that, what\nyou have to do is confine it. Because when you confine gun powder, you increase the concentration\nof all the reagents. They don't just blow away from each other when they catch fire. So they're forced into closer\nproximity, so they react more. Plus you trap more of the heat, so the reagents get moving\nfaster, they have more energy, and so they can react more readily. So I put 10 grams of\ngunpowder in a cardboard tube and taped it shut. (explosion pops) Okay, that's better. But it wasn't as big of a\nbang as I was hoping for. Well, it was a bit more\nof a pop than than a bang. Maybe we need a tighter vessel, I think. So I'm gonna use some\nfiber reinforced tape to strengthen the container, and then we should get a bigger bang. (explosion booms)\nOoh! - It went right past me. (explosion booms) - It's more of a bang.\nThat's a bit more like it. Here I have 20 grams of black powder. So I guess the question is\nwith twice the black powder, do we get twice the bang? Here we go, everyone get back. (explosion booming) This is essentially what a firework is. I mean, fireworks consist of a shell The shell with a lot of gunpowder inside. - So, this is an inert shell. It's colorized so that you can see the\nindividual pieces better. A real shell, everything\nin here would be black because it would be primed\nor covered with black powder. - Actually a note about terminology. For a long time the terms\ngunpowder and black powder were used in interchangeably. But these days the formula\nfor gunpowder has changed to make it smokeless. So what's used in fireworks is called, at least in the US, black powder, to distinguish it from\nmodern smokeless gunpowder. Just know that in this\nvideo we'll use both terms to mean basically the same thing. - The shell itself is made out a cardboard and what looks like and\nis a form of paper mache with craft paper and a glue. And you go around and around once you put the two\nshell halves together. - Is that like the standard\nsize you'd see when you go out? - So on a 4th of July display, you'll see anything\nfrom two and a half inch up to five inch typically. In most cases, six inch and above are reserved for locations\nthat you have a huge property, you're out in some desert shoot site or on a barge somewhere. But they can go even bigger\nthan this, up to 12 inch, 16 and even larger in very special occasions. This is the hemisphere for a\n16 inch diameter aerial shell. - That is a huge firework. The biggest aerial firework\never was 1.44 meters wide, and it weighed about the same as a car. (speaker gasping) - Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh!\n- Whoooh! - Whoa. (all laughing) - To launch a firework into the air, the way it's done is\nwith more black powder. - In a typical shell, you're gonna have a baggie of black powder that's underneath the shell, and that acts to fire the\nshell out of the mortar to the 800 feet in the air, which is what this eight\ninch shell would go to. Shells as large as say a 16 inch, those can use literally\npounds of black powder underneath them. - To ensure the shell goes straight up. It's placed in a big plastic\ntube called a mortar. - A pyro technician gets two bangs for every one the audience does. You get a bang when the mortar fires and then a bang when the shell explodes. (explosions booming) And it's literally like a cannon, shooting a cannon ball in the air. So the audience doesn't get\nto hear or see or feel that, but the pyro crew does. (explosions booming) (audience cheering) - Does everything burn up\nbefore it reaches the ground? - The internal contents, yes. So all the stars, the\nburst, all of that stuff, the casing will come down in pieces. That's why we have a fallout\nzone is what we call it. Or the exclusion zone, where only the crew is\nallowed with all their PPEs because you do get debris that comes down. It literally sounds like rain at the end from all of the debris from that finale, shells going off all at once. - How often do they malfunction? Explosion - It's rare, but it does happen. You'll have a wooden rack with a few HDPE, high density polyethylene mortars in it. And that particular\nmaterial is meant to expand and split from the energy\nof a malfunctioning shell versus explode and throw\nshrapnel everywhere. - We actually experienced\nan incident like this with the biggest shell\nwe had set to launch. Okay, in three, two, one. (explosion pops) Oh, oh. That one did not look like it... (explosion booms) Oh!\n(laughs) That's what happens when\na firework doesn't lift. - But because we follow all\nthe rules and regulations at a professional display, it's usually the crowd going, whoa. And the crew going, whoa. (explosion booms) - Oh my God. (both laughing) - And then the show goes on is typically what happens\nafter a few safety checks when something like that goes on. - Thankfully everyone was safe because we could trigger\nthe fireworks remotely from outside the blast radius. But igniting explosives safely\nhas long been a challenge. Black Match - In the mining industry, their delay method back then was to literally sprinkle\nout a trail of black powder through the mine to give\nthem a delay to the dynamite. - The simplest fuse just\nconsists of cotton string that's been soaked in black powder and then allowed to dry out. This is known as black match. It burns well, but pretty slowly. - That alone would burn two\nto three seconds an inch. But once you encase it in craft paper, that's literally all this is, you change that burn rate\nfrom a couple seconds an inch to anywhere from 30 to\na hundred feet a second. - This has the same effect as containing the black powder. It traps in the heat and reagents, so the reaction goes much faster. - This is actually how we\nshoot our finale so fast. We're not actually pushing\nbuttons that quickly. - This type of fuse is\nappropriately known as quick match. Quick Match Now, before I'd ever seen\nquick match in action, it was suggested that I\ntry to race the signal down the fuse. What I'm gonna do is light this little piece\nof black match right here, and then I'm gonna try to race\nthe signal to the other end. But still, I was not\nprepared for what came next. (suspenseful music) (explosions popping)\nAh! Jesus, what the heck was that? (suspenseful music)\n(explosions popping) You are kidding me. You didn't tell me it was gonna do that. The force of the combustion products causes the quick match\nto whip around wildly. It's crazy how much just\ncontaining the reagents and containing the heat from\nthe reaction accelerates it. It certainly burns much\nfaster than the black match Waterproof without the paper. (explosion pops)\nAh! Man. Every time, every time that gets me. One problem with these basic fuses is they aren't waterproof. Even though they contain\nthe fuel and the oxidizer, so they don't need the\noxygen and the air to burn, they do need heat and\nwater is just too good at conducting the heat away from the fuse. So it snuffs out the reaction. And it fizzles out. The same problem occurs with road flares. I thought since the flame comes\nout with such high pressure, it might be able to stay lit under water. Three, two, one. (water splashes) And it did for a little while, but eventually the water got\nin there and stole the heat. So I think that the\nwater is putting it out by pulling the heat away from it so it doesn't have enough\nenergy to keep burning. (water burbling) You bring it out. Come on, come on. Ah. - Wait, look. - He-ey! (both laugh) - Ooh! - And it's... (water burbling) There are special flares made\nfor underwater applications, but even those have similar problems. (water burbling) You can see the gaseous\ncombustion products being released here and\nbubbling to the surface. And while this flare lasted longer, the water still eventually put it out. Come on. Why did that go out? But it is possible to\nmake a waterproof fuse. Fireworks - So this is your traditional visco fuse. You're gonna see this in a lot\nof your consumer fireworks. (calm music) - Very big firework store. (cheerful music) I feel like we have to get this, spins? - Yeah. - And it makes fire? - Yeah. - I'm excited about this one. Here we go in three, two, one. - [Mike] It's really got a powder core with a fiber wrap to it. (fireworks popping) (laughing) And it's typically lacquer coated. So these fuses are typically waterproof. (explosion popping) - Whoa! (water burbling) Wow! (laughs) That was impressive. Fuses are not only used\nto light fireworks, Fuses they are a core component\ninside a firework. - So that quick match flashes really quick down into the black\npowder lift that ignites. And while it's pushing the\nshell out of the mortar, it lights the time fuse. So this is what would\nactually be in the shell to give you the time delay. From the time the lift charge fires to the time the shell hits\napogee and explodes in the sky. You know, it's about a\nquarter inch in diameter and is really a black\npowder core rigid fuse compared to the more flimsy visco type. - It's really important\nthat the time delay fuse keeps the combustion contained inside it so the firework only\nexplodes when you want it to, at the very peak of its trajectory. So we tested it underwater. Do you think it's waterproof? - Should be. - All right. It's taking its time. There we go. That looks like a firework type fuse. - [Mike] These function by not spitting any fire out the side so that the shell doesn't\nget lit prematurely. - That's smart. - [Mike] So you should only\nsee it spit out the end once it's made it's all the way through. - What's containing it? Like what kind of material\nis containing it in there? - [Mike] Well, there's a number... There's weaves of fibers in\nthere and a layer of asphalt that really provides that waterproofing. - So you can kind of see how the signal is progressing. You can see how the fire's\nprogressing through there. 'Cause obviously it's getting hot. Some of the gaseous\nproducts are coming up. Oh, is it gonna come out? Was that it? - [Mike] That was it. - That is all that is needed to ignite the core of a firework. (both laugh) - So after that time fuse hits its end, it'll light a piece of black match that'll then flash into the burst charge. So that's what's represented\nby this blue material, which is typically rice hulls\nor something similar to that coated with black powder. - What are ri... Oh rice hulls. - Yes. Rice hulls, not holes, sorry. - I was like they're making\nrice holes like donut holes. - The reason we coat rice hulls is because you get a very granular powder in the center of the shell now, which allows the flame\nto propagate very quickly through the shell, igniting\neverything simultaneously, creating that significant\nover pressure very quickly to blow the shell open. So a traditional peony shell would be your most basic of fireworks, where these stars would literally\nbe lining the hemisphere and then you'd have\nyour burst in the middle and that would give you a very symmetrical\nround sphere in the sky, your traditional firework that you see. - But it's just interesting to think that when you see a firework go off, you know, all those little points of light are about that size. - [Mike] Yeah. - But they look... I mean I would say that\nthey look bigger, right? 'Cause they're so bright, I guess. - Yeah. (drone whistling) - So fast. - How fast does this thing go? - Pretty quick and it\nis definitely trickier when it's dark like this. - Okay, can you see anything? - [Gene] Once I go start looking here, I'm like, I'm not sure. - How do you get focused to\nsomething that's not there yet and you're not quite sure where\nit is or where anything is 'cause it's all pitch black? - 'Cause I basically have\nlocked exposure on this. And we can at least see\nhow the exposure is. - Taking off. (drone whistling)\n(fireworks popping) - Yes. Amazing. Blue. (calm music) - Oh shoot, okay. - Oh, dang.\n- FPV's down. - [Gene] Oh dang. I didn't realize I was\nso close to the ground. All right, hold on. Stars - I just wanna see what\nthis looks like, you know, I wanna check this out. So. Whoa, that is cool. I dig that. These stars are made of black powder mixed with chemicals to give\nthem different properties. - [Mike] So brocade crown star would be the big bushy gold tail that you would see in the sky. So imagine a big glittering gold shell. (indistinct chatters) - I could actually see the\nlittle pieces coming off and glowing pretty bright right now. - [Mike] Now, imagine those leaving a tail as they fly through the sky. It's a really spectacular effect. - This is gonna be blue. Ah. Often the chemicals mixed into the stars are used to create specific colors. - [Mike] Each of these stars would be coated with a primer composition, which is a really fine black powder. The reason for that is a\nlot of color compositions take more heat to ignite, so they have a higher\nignition temperature. So by coating with black\npowder, with that primer, you're ensuring ignition of all the stars, which then transfer the fire\nto that color composition. (calm music) - And then it started taking off on you. (imitates firework) That's cool. I like that. (calm music) Jeez it's bright. The colors of fireworks are actually thanks to quantum mechanics. Quantum Mechanics An element absorbs energy\nfrom the combustion raising an electron to\na higher energy level. And there are only certain\ntransitions which are allowed. So when the electron drops back down to a lower energy level,\nit gives off light with a specific energy of that transition, which corresponds to a particular color. Some elements are particularly well-suited to create certain colors. So as the copper ions go in there, Blue Color they absorb energy from the\nfire, from the combustion, and then the electrons drop back down to a lower energy level and they give out that\nblue light predominantly. And that's why we get\nsuch a great blue color. What a thing of beauty. This is just a little interjection because I was looking at our flame tests and the copper salt tests, you know, anywhere you look, copper\nfireworks are meant to be blue, like bright blue, but those\nflame tests look kind of green. And so I didn't really\nknow what was going on, but I was sitting here\nplaying with my kids with the KiwiCo flame test kit. I know like they did sponsor this video, but didn't tell me to put\na section like this in. But what I found is that, okay, I'm using a copper salt\nhere and it starts out green and then if you leave it for\na while, come zoom in here, it starts to get blue. Oh, look at that blue. To get the beautiful blue color.\nI think you need more heat. I think it's a higher\ntemperature that we need that we didn't achieve in our\nflame tests out in the field. Here we got some calcium\nchloride. Oh yeah. Oh, that is a beautiful orange. Look at that. Here we're getting some potassium chloride to give us some violet. I'm not seeing too much violet, but maybe just a little. Barium chloride. Of course, that's just small scale. Our pyro technician mixed\nup some color salt and fuel in a mortar. - [Mike] What's in there is\nabout two gallons of methanol with boric acid on this one. (explosion booms) (both laughing) And copper(II) chloride on this one. - Three, two, one. Fire.\n(explosion booms) Yeah! That was awesome. (calm music) That is the beauty of quantum mechanics. The electron transitions that give rise to the\ncolor of fireworks are, at least in my opinion, way cooler than colored smoke bombs. So the combustion products here are solid, and that's why they make so much smoke. In this case, there's just dye in the\nsmoke to give it its color. Yes. To make so-called ghost shells, the stars are coated in\nlayers of different chemicals, which allows them to\nchange color mid-flight. - So assuming your shell\nconstruction was very uniform, your casing, all your\nstars are the same mass, you're gonna get a very\nuniform explosion in the sky. So it's really as simple as how you lay out the stars in the shell and it'll break in that\npattern in the sky. - So what's your favorite patterned? - Jellyfish are pretty neat. If you've ever seen a jellyfish, it really looks like a jellyfish. You get the dome and then you get tentacles\ncoming out the bottom. - That sounds amazing. - [Mike] Yeah. - Do they just do it by changing the color and position of the stars up here? Like how do you get a\ndome and then tentacles? - If this was the shell and you'd have another half this way, only the top half would be covered- - Would be fully covered. - And that would be your dome. And then you'd have a couple larger stars to create the large tentacles\nthat come out the bottom. - Ah. These days fireworks\naren't usually triggered by lighting a fuse by hand,\nbut by pushing a button. - Each one of these buttons would correspond to an\nindividual firing circuit going out into the field. - The button sends current down the wire to an electric match. A little filament in the match heats up, triggering a chemical reaction. - [Mike] Which then spits fire into whatever you're trying to light. Fireworks Finale - [Gene] Yeah, I think it's just... - Dust in the motors? - I think so. This might be a pretty quick repair. - We are about to have a fireworks finale in the middle of nowhere in the pitch dark for like a minute. And we're gonna try to\nfly FPV drone through it. So what does it actually\nlook like to be in the middle where all the fireworks\nare exploding in three, two, one. (drone whistling)\n(fireworks popping) - Thank you. (fireworks popping) (upbeat music)\n(fireworks popping) Wow. Can we get some light on the ground here? (laughing) - That was insane. - The fireworks finale\ntriggered my car alarm. - They were like two\ntimes where I was like, \"I'm not sure if I'm upside down or not, but I gotta hold this shot.\" Okay, so - [All] Whoa. (hopeful music) - Oh man. Right through\nthem, right around them. Just parked right down into that. (all laughing) Whoa, that is so wicked. - Dude. - Yeah, there we go. (all laughing) - You're upside down. - [Gene] Right there. (hopeful music) I was just chasing everything. (hopeful music) - Fireworks are this perfect\ncombination of chemistry, light, and sound. If their purpose is to banish bad spirits, I'd say they achieve it. (fireworks booming) Kiwico (squicky sound) Hey, this video was sponsored by KiwiCo. You know, every time a KiwiCo\ncrate shows up at our house, my kids get really excited. (screaming) What is it guys? - I love me this one. - You light it on fire and it\nmakes different color flames. (gasps) - The different chemicals you put on? - Uh-huh. And that's because they know what's inside is a hands-on project that\nthey get to build with me. And the building is a lot of fun and playing with it\nafterwards is even better. From my perspective, the best part is that my kids\nare learning about science, technology, engineering and design while playing and having fun. And I think that is the best way to learn. So the way it works is that each month KiwiCo delivers a crate right to your door and inside is everything you\nneed to complete the project. And I mean everything. So there are no additional\ntrips to the store. We've been getting crates\nfor three years now. So we've built lots of different projects and they're all high quality. I got to tour KiwiCO's headquarters, so I saw how their crates\nare designed by experts and then tested with kids\nbefore they're ever sent out. They're also really good value. Most KiwiCo subscriptions work\nout to around $20 per month. They have nine different product lines targeted at different age groups. Everything from newborns up to 14 plus so your kids can grow with\nKiwiCo just as mine have. I think my favorite thing is\nthat working on these projects has become something that we do together. Every month there is this thought starter and an invitation to spend\nsome quality time together and it just arrives on our doorstep and I really appreciate that. So if you wanna try it out, go to kiwico.com/veritasium\nto get your first month free. Using my link, you're not\nonly getting a great deal, you're also helping to\nsupport this channel. And if you want to purchase single crates, that's also an option\nthrough the KiwiCo store. They make great gifts. So I wanna thank KiwiCo\nfor sponsoring this video and I wanna thank you for watching.",
